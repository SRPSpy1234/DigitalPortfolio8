        <!--Paragraph about my course description-->
        <p>
            The English 8 curriculum builds on the skills and habits of mind developed in grades 5 through 7, while also serving as a bridge to the Upper School English program. The course helps our students sharpen and improve the articulation of their ideas not only in class discussions but also in various writing projects. By attending closely to questions of literary form throughout the year, we aim to help students become more inquisitive, lucid, and compelling in their thinking, writing, speaking, and listening. Throughout the year, students write both analytically about the course materials and creatively, drawing on their understanding of form to create original works of art.
