            THEATER 8 is a semester-length course divided into two sections. The students in Theater Arts 8 recapitulate vocabulary and basic theater skills and expand their understanding of the group nature of the dramatic situation. With emphasis on improvisation, physical work, and group investigation, the students prepare themselves to achieve and appreciate the art of theater. The students in Theater Production 8 address themselves to the performance of scripted material in a workshop environment. The collaborative nature of theater is stressed as well as the close tie between creativity and discipline. Their piece is performed for an invited audience.
