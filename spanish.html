        <p>
            The main emphasis of this course is to improve and refine studentsâ€™ communication skills in Spanish. We study all verb tenses in the indicative and subjunctive moods, as well as many new grammatical structures and idiomatic expressions. Writing activities become more substantial, striving for better accuracy. Teachers utilize audio-visual devices to present and practice the new material and for some units the students present their work creating technology-based projects. After the winter break, we put greater emphasis on the development of reading skills through age-appropriate literature. Students are expected to participate in class discussions entirely in Spanish.
