           History 8 is a comparative and thematic examination of global history from the beginning of agriculture up until 1500. In addition to a study of specific societies, we examine dynamics and structures common to different cultures, as well as how those cultures interact. The class will look at the subject matter from a number of perspectives, including social, political, cultural, economic, religious, and environmental history. Special attention will be given to primary sources and the way historians interpret them.

The 8th grade curriculum continues to stress the development of academic skills. Students are expected to listen attentively to and participate actively in class discussions. They read from a variety of sources and write analytical essays, and within research projects, students continue to practice the skills of synthesizing information, organizing it, and assessing and citing sources. The course encourages a curiosity and appreciation of the past, purposefully relates the present to the past, and develops critical thinking and writing skills.
