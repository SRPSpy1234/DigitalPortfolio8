        <p>
            This class offers instruction in four disciplines; fabrication, electronics, web design, and programming, each with its own set of tools, techniques, hardware, software, space requirements, and time management challenges. Students will develop a strong foundational understanding of these fields through note taking, classroom discussions, exercises, and hands-on projects. Students will start by learning traditional woodworking tools, using them to fabricate a car stereo system and wiring its components. Next, they will delve into programming, exploring C/C++ with Arduino microcontrollers and using this knowledge to write programs to control electronic components. Throughout this course, students will be encouraged to utilize the Stanford Design Thinking Process in order to create innovative projects. This process will guide them as they conceive, develop, test, and iterate their ideas. As a culmination project, students will design a fifteen page website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase their work across all four disciplines. Upon completing this class, students will have acquired the technical skills necessary to succeed in high school and in a global and digital world.
