            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            <!-- Paragraph about my academic profile -->
            <p>
                8th grade science is an introductory survey course in physical science â€“ the study of matter and energy and how they affect each other. Specific topics we consider include force, motion, energy, the particles of matter, and how matter interacts chemically. Students will also have the opportunity to explore specific topics in Biology that dovetail with their investigations in physics and chemistry in order to help prepare them for upper school courses. This will include looking at chemical interactions in the human body and discussing the flow of energy in the biosphere.
                <br><br>
                The broad objectives of physical science include the development of laboratory skills, reasoning skills (such as the application of knowledge to new situations), modeling skills (both physical and mathematical), and communication skills.  Students engage in hands-on activities, projects, and lab investigations to illuminate the course content and develop critical thinking and inquiry.
                <br><br>
                This course will help students develop a level of appreciation for science that makes it possible for them to share the richness and excitement that comes from a deeper understanding of the natural world. Integrating specific biochemistry and bio-physics lessons will help students build on previous knowledge to help them prepare for more advanced content.
